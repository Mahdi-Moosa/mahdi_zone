The name of the repo that hosted my blog source file(s) was named mahdi_zone. So the URL for the homepage kept on coming as mahdi-moosa.github.io/mahdi_zone with mahdi-moosa.github.io giving a 404 error.</p> <p>After digging a while (and chatting with Gemini Advanced), I found out that if the repo is named as .github.io then the homepage will be .github.io. So, I changed the repo name from GitHub GUI. Removed remote repo (mahdi_zone) from the VS Code Source Control and tried to add the new repo by \"Source Control&gt; Three Dot Click (...)&gt; Remote&gt; Add\".
